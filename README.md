# nem-bidding-dashboard

nem-bidding-dashboard is a python package for collating, processing and visualising data relevant to understanding participant behaviour in the Australian National Electricity Market wholesale spot market. It is still under development, but once complete its main features will include utilities for downloading publicly available bidding and operational data from the Australian Energy Market Operator, processing the data to minimise storage requirements and precomputing some values to be used later in data visualisation, storing and retrieving the data from a PostgreSQL database, aggregating the data, and finally visualising the data. This functionality will be accessible through the package API or the web app.
